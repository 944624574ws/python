Current research of aesthetic assessment for images assumes one aesthetic score or one aesthetic label for an image, ignoring the relations of multiple aesthetic-related attributes. However, most images can be described by multiple aesthetic attributes simultaneously. 
Therefore, in this paper, we prop ose multiple aesthetic attribute prediction and clas-si?cation by mo deling relations among aesthetic attributes
through Bayesian Networks (BN). In order to realize contin-uous aesthetic attribute prediction, each aesthetic attribute is represented by a three-no de BN, including the discretized aesthetic attribute label, the predicted aesthetic attribute
score, and the measurement of the aesthetic attribute s-core. In addition, the relations among multiple aesthet-ic attributes are mo deled by another discrete BN, whose structure and conditional probabilities are learned from the
training data. The attribute measurements are obtained by an existing image-driven regression metho d. With the learned BN, we infer the true discrete label and continuous score for each attribute by combining the relations among
attributes with the previously obtained measurements. Experiments on the Memorability dataset show the sup eriority of our prop osed approach to current image-driven methods for both multiple continuous aesthetic attribute score pre-diction and multiple discrete aesthetic attribute lab el classi-?cation, indicating the e?ectiveness of the captured relations
for aesthetic quality assessment.
